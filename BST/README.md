##Binary Search Tree

Binary Search trees are another ADT to store values in a binary tree, the advantages of using a binary tree is that 
you can perform most operation in logarithmic time on average however the catch is that insert sorted elements into
a BST can create a scenario where the tree becomes unblanced providing worst case scenario of O(n) time for search
operations making them no better than a linked list. Balanced trees like AVL can prevent this from happening. This
scenario prints all of the nodes in order and as you can see the tree is left heavy due to the order in which the
elements were inserted.
